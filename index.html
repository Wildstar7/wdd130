            <p>Hello! My name is Kyle Strasdas and I currently live in Springfield, OR with my wife Gracie. We are very excited to soon have a temple very closeby when the Willamette Valley Temple is complete! I enjoy anything outdoors and playing most sports, although volleyball in particular has been my focus most recently. Currently I am employed as an Administrative/Legal Assistant at a law firm, but look forward to getting more involved in software and web sevelopment in the near future. </p>

            <p>Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, an area known for its temperate rain forests. Oregon is home to many outdoor opportunities and a diverse landscape. From high deserts, mountain peaks, forests, lakes and rivers, to high deserts, rocky coasts, and sand dunes, there is something here for everyone!</p>
